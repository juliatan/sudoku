Sudoku Solver
=============

This was a fun side challenge I did around Week 5 at Makers Academy.

The objective was to write Ruby code that would be able to solve a simple Sudoku puzzle 
(i.e. one where there would be no need for iterations).

If you are not familiar with Sudoku, you can read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

Technologies used
-----------------

* Ruby
* RSpec

Potential improvements
----------------------

Amend code so that harder Sudoku puzzles involving iterations can be solved.

How to use
----------

```shell
git clone git@github.com:juliatan/sudoku.git
cd sudoku
ruby sudoku.rb
```

How to run tests
----------------

```shell
cd sudoku
rspec
```
